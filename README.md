# Introduction

This repository contains the code for the paper "Botometer 101: Social bot practicum for computational social scientists."

To demonstrate how to use [Botometer](https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/) for bot detection in research, we provide a simple case study and share the source code here.

# How to

## Obtain API keys

To replicate this case study, you will need a valid Twitter developer key with access to the V1 API.
You can apply at developer.twitter.com.
You will also need a valid RapidAPI account, which you can register at https://rapidapi.com.
Once you have a RapidAPI account, please subscribe to a plan on https://rapidapi.com/OSoMe/api/botometer-pro/pricing .
Now you are ready!

## Data collection

Please refer to the scripts under folder [/scripts](/scripts) for code and instructions to fetch data from Twitter and perform bot detection.

## Data analysis

Please refer to the jupyter notebook under folder [/exps](/exps) for code to analyze the collected data and visualize the results.

# Dependency

This demonstration uses Python3.7 and the following packages:

- [`botometer-python`](https://github.com/IUNetSci/botometer-python): query the Botometer Pro API
- [`tweepy`](https://www.tweepy.org/): access Twitter API; please use versions >= 3.5.0,<4 that `botometer-python` depends on as well
- [`requests`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/): make HTTPS requests

If you also want to replicate the analysis, you will also need

- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [`scipy`](https://scipy.org/)
